## Code
The `requirements.txt` file in this directory contains all requirements to run all Python samples in the book.

### Preparing to run the code
The samples are all written in Python. Some of the sample code uses example data also found in this repository. 
To run the code, you will need a version of Python 3 installed on your system - the code has been tested with the latest release at the time of writing (3.13.7). Installers for Python are available from the Python website at https://www.python.org/. 

Each chapter contains a *requirements.txt* file with the dependencies for the code samples in that chapter. It is recommended to create a different virtual environment for each chapter samples, and instructions are provided in the chapter directory.
